    <p class="about-me">Hi! I'm &nbsp;<span> Althaf</span> , a passionate computer science student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications. My interest in web development has led me to dive into front-end technologies, and I have gained a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. I also have a growing understanding of JavaScript, and I'm constantly improving my skills to build more dynamic and interactive websites. <br> <br>

        As I continue to learn and explore the world of coding, I aspire to become a full-stack developer, with expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm driven by the challenge of solving problems through code and the satisfaction of creating functional, user-friendly web applications. <br> <br>
        
        Along the way, I'm expanding my knowledge of modern frameworks, databases, and server-side technologies to complement my current skills. I'm eager to work on real-world projects that will help me grow and contribute to the tech community.</p>
